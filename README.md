# Distribution-Shifts

This repository conatains the Colab Notebook for performing image classification tasks while tackling Distribution Shifts.
(The algorithm proposed reduces the computational search space for finding the combination of a DL model and a re-weighting algorithm)

Re-Weighting Algorithms used
1. RuLSIF
2. KMM
3. KLIEP

Models used for training puprposes

1. DenseNet121
2. ResNet50
3. Baseline CNN

Datasets used
1. CIFAR10-C
2. MNIST-C
3. SVHN ( Street View Housing Number)
4. STL-10
